= Transform documents in RSS feeds for Java (hirss)

hirss allows to transform no RSS documents/info in rss feeds

== Compile

You need Apache Maven.

From root directory open a terminal and execute:

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean compile assembly:single
----

A jar file,  hirss-*.jar will be created in target/ folder.

== Run

Open a terminal and execute:

[source,bash]
----
java -jar target/hirss-*.jar
----

A new HTTP Server listening by default on port 1225 will start and, depending on the plugins created,
RSS XML files will be generated in $HOME/.hirss/rss folder

Just add the name of the rss feed (file) generated inside $HOME/.hirss/rss folder in your rss feed reader;
example http://127.0.0.1:1225/b10a8db164e0754105b7a99be72e3fe5

== Configuration

Configuration is defined in hirss.properties; you can override these parameters:

[source,bash]
----
#binding address of HTTP Server
binding_address=127.0.0.1
#binding port of HTTP Server
port=1225
#max concurrent HTTP request
max_threads=50
#default folder where RSS XML are generated
rss_folder=.hirss/rss
#interval in milliseconds to upload the RSS
rss_update_period=5000
#timeout in seconds to establish a connection to the source
rss_connect_timeout=25000

----

== Plugin

You can create plugins simply adding a java class annotated with @Extension and implementing the interface
SimpleRssDoc.

@Extension

public class HelloWorld implements SimpleRssDoc {

Your class must fetch data from somewhere (web scraping as an example) and returning an instance of java object
org.hifly.hirss.model.Rss

After creating your plugin simply recompile the entire project and run it.

The plugin will be automatically discovered and a new RSS XML file will be generated with your feeds.
